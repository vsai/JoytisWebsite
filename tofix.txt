Things to fix:

- Feedback form:
---- alert should not shift the whole page down.
---- if failure, make all the required boxes turn red
---- if success return everythin to normal

- Footer on every page:
---- Sticky footer that you can always see at the bottom of the page. Does not tag onto the bottom of the text.


- Header:
---- New two line header, with navbar of shorter height than title bar
---- Navbar central and justified across
---- Standardize across all pages.
